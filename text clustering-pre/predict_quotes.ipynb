       "'I\\'m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can\\'t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don\\'t deserve me at my best.No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.Life is what happens to you while you\\'re busy making other plans.It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.That which does not kill us makes us stronger.Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn\\'t it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything.Who are you to judge the life I live?I know I\\'m not perfect-and I don\\'t live to be-but before you start pointing fingers...make sure you hands are clean!Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn\\'t that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you.The best way to make your audience laugh is to start laughing yourself.Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.Infuse your life with action.

And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.It is the ability to take a joke, not make one, that proves you have a sense of humor.Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I\\'m trying to say is I\\'m trying to liberate them, I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.The great gift of Easter is hope - Christian hope which makes us have that confidence in God, in his ultimate triumph, and in his goodness and love, which nothing can shake.Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.When I am finishing a picture, I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand - as a final test. If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make, the painting is authentic. If there\\'s a clash between the two, it\\'s bad art.That\\'s my actual payment, the fact that I can actually make something that I actually enjoy and put on repeat, and it\\'s not related to anything else or anyone else\\'s thoughts and ideas, it all came from me; I just love that aspect of it.My attitude towards drawing is not necessarily about drawing. It\\'s about making the best kind of image I can make, it\\'s about talking as clearly as I can.And I ask why am I black, they say I was born in sin, and shamed inequity.

I wear colors that I really like, I wear makeup that makes me feel pretty, and it really helps. It doesn\\'t have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see.Life is all about evolution. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone in my life. Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if people misunderstood or judged me, I have learned from these incidents. We are human and we make mistakes, but learning from them is what makes the difference.Don\\'t walk through life just playing football. Don\\'t walk through life just being an athlete. Athletics will fade.

Granted I don\\'t want her to trash the house, but we do make a lot of messes.I don\\'t believe in having one partner for your whole life, but I hope I get married.

There\\'s no wrong you can\\'t make right again, so be kinder to yourself, you know, have fun, take chances. There\\'s no bounds.The ability to make somebody feel something: that\\'s art. However you look at it, whether you\\'re an author, a painter, a singer, a rapper, a spoken-word artist - art.Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they\\'re making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that\\'s the difference.Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success.You can be discouraged by failure, or you can learn from it.

Life is so difficult, and I cope with it by making jokes about absolutely everything.Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.Flaming enthusiasm, backed up by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success.Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence.An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.What makes photography a strange invention is that its primary raw materials are light and time.I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You\\'re doing things you\\'ve never done before, and more importantly, you\\'re doing something.Remembering that I\\'ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

Children who are obedient and responsible bring to their parents unending pride and satisfaction.A secondhand wardrobe hand clothes doesn\\'t make one an artist.

To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you\\'ll soon find many others around you.

There was only one gift he held back - length of life.Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn\\'t thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I\\'m just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation comes from playing the game I love.

Because if you are making mistakes...you\\'re Doing Something.Whatever you want to do, if you want to be great at it, you have to love it and be able to make sacrifices for it.The art of acceptance is the art of making someone who has just done you a small favor wish that he might have done you a greater one.Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.In acting, there\\'s a type of courage you\\'re recognized for all the time. You lose 100 pounds and play a guy with AIDS, and you get rewarded. But, in life, doing what is courageous is quiet, and no one knows about it.
